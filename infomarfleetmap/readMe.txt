This is a simple html file that has an embedded map from Marine Traffic (marinetraffic.com) website.  

This map is then iframed into https://www.infomar.ie/maps/interactive-maps/follow-fleet site.

To change the vessels that are shown you need to log into marinetraffic.com with "infomarmapping@gmail.com" account (ask Data Management for pword).  Edit the vessels that are in the default fleet (INFOMAR Follow the Fleet) and this will then be updated in the viewer.  Currently (13/02/2023) the default fleet is:
Celtic Explorer
Tom Crean
Keary
Lir

You can modify some simple display settings in this html file, settings commented in the code.
